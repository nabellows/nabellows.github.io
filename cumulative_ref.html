                <p>
                    I greatly value my experience here at Iowa State University. While I think there are a lot of things that could be learned outside of university in Computer Science and related fields, 
                    if I were to choose my path again, I would still choose the experience I had at Iowa State. I entered college with some skill in programmatic thinking, from programming
                    calculators, basic Arduino programs, and online game scripting. However, my very first semester at Iowa State, my course on introductory programming with C (CprE 185) immediately
                    spurred my interest in a new way, and I was inspired by the labs and personal programming assignments to learn more about the language and program for fun again.
                    Having started my <i>real</i> programming with C, the systems programming language, probably shaped the rest of my programming trajectory (I would never have chosen C on my own, due to my lack of 
                    knowledge). I was soon introduced to Java and tought design patterns and object-oriented programming principles. 
                    Later, I took digital logic classes, the basics of which I was already familiar with due to hobby projects, but I took it much further at Iowa State and excelled in that class. 
                    It was about at this point that I was confident that Computer Engineering was the right field of engineering for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from learning the languages tought by my courses, and the topics directly out of the course syllabi, Iowa State introduced me to important technologies that helped me 
                    understand Computer Engineering in my personal and professional experiences, and gave me the ability to confidently 'hack' and keep learning on my own. 
                    I was introduced to countless things, like using the command line, ncurses, compilers, IDEs, embedded systems, FPGAs, electronics, networking, Linux, computer architecture, and more.
                    As much as I learned new things, I also learned about how much I <i>did not</i> know, and was inspried by my peers and faculty with greater experiences or different skillsets than me. 
                    Eventually I was even interested in graduate schooling and research, which I would not have predicted when I entered the university. 
                    However, I did stay with my decision to graduate (for now) with my Bachelor's and start a career afterwards, since my Bachelor's degree here is still valuable and enough to get me quite
                    far in the industry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iowa State University gave me a lot more experience with and respect for other people (as strange as it sounds). 
                    Being surrounded by other people headed in a similar direction, with often similar interests and skillsets can be quite humbling. 
                    While I was not of a bad attitude or anything, I always felt like I had different abilities and interests compared to most peers in high school. 
                    This is very different when taking all of your classes with other engineers. I now had people who could challenge, or even outperform me in math, 
                    problem solving, or other areas that I would be used to leading in. My ability to work on a team grew significantly, even if it is something I will continue to improve on.
                    Dividing up work to different people on team projects, trying to catering well to our teams' diverse skillsets, was something I hadn't experienced in a similar way before university.
                    Solving long technincal problems with others introduces lengthy discussions, sometimes disagreements, and eventually learning and respect in all the parties.

                    The actual content of my studies at Iowa State is another reason it was my favorite part of my education. 
                    Working mostly on tasks of problem solving, complex computer and software systems, and other related problems is much more satisfying to me than
                    any of my previous coursework in my life. I found exactly what captivated my interest, and it was actually fun to complete assignments, and even take 
                    them beyond the expectations and requirements for my own personal learning and ambition. 
                    In my final two years at Iowa State University, I started taking most of my technical elective courses. 
                    Most of these were by far my favorite courses at Iowa State, where I could most directly direct my personal interest into my learning.
                    I loved studying computer architecture, implementing processors and complex systems such as our graphics processor (CprE 480), and more.
                    I got to work with faculty who shared similar interests, and inspired me in many ways (including being in awe at their accomplishments). 
                    In fact, I chose to take more technical electives than I needed for graduation just out of interest.
                    Even still, I felt like there were more courses and learning experiences that I <i>wanted</i> to do, than I actually had time for. 
                    This made me realize that I can never learn enough, and there is so much to come back for (for the purposes of graduate study). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will cherish my experiences at Iowa State University for the rest of my life. Not only did I become more capable and prepared for engineering, 
                    but I also worked with amazing students and faculty. I had wonderful expereiences in music, engineering, and with friends on campus. 
                    In my final weeks before graduation I could not believe it was all coming to an end, even after five years. 
                    Iowa State gave me so much knowledge, energy, friendships, preparation, and wisdom, and I am very grateful for that.
