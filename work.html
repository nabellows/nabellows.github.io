                            <li>Learned the challenge of deadlines and time/quality compromises that exist in industry projects (this does not mean careless quality, but rather the bidding process, and knowing when to move on instead of refactoring).</li>

                            <li>Greatly accelerated my interest and learning of C++ under a resident C++ expert (they have authored a C++ Boost library: an extremely high accomplishment...).</li>
                            <li>Got a taste of Test Driven Development, even though most of the time I would write ahead of the testing.
