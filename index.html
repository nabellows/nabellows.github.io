            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>I'm Nathan Bellows, a Computer Engineering senior at Iowa State University. 
                I'm interested in a mix of software and computer architecture. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Some of the courses that stirred my interest and increased the value of my education here at Iowa State University were those that involved computer architecture, designing processors, accelerators, and application-specific hardware in HDL (VHDL). 
                My experience taking and later being a Teacher's Assistant for 'Graphics Processing and Architecture' (CprE 480) will forever be some of my favorate ISU course/project work.
                My studies in the higher level 'Computer Systems Architecture' course (CprE 581) provided me a challenge in learning the vast depth of intricacies in modern computer/processor architecture. However, I felt like it resulted in a great increase in confidence in my knowledge and ability to discuss and reason about the processors which are used in actual systems today (to a much greater extent than the teachings of lower level architecture courses). The class being designed for graduate students also involved a good introduction to reading and following historical and modern white papers, as well as discussing architectural tradeoffs with and against my peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in software is spread amongst a wide array of topics. 
                I am most specialized in C/C++ programming, being a C++ hobbyist with significant experience, study, and enjoyment of the language. 
                I am interested in programming language design, compilers, software optimization, grammar theory and parsing, and related topics. 
                I also enjoy learning about and applying software design patterns and "clean code" paradigms. 
                I enjoy writing high-level C++/Java utilities or libraries, especially if they dig into interesting corners of the language.
                However, I am also particularly interested in embedded programming, and really enjoy building physical products which interact with the real world.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my future career in the industry, my goals are to work on new technologies and products, rather than just optimizing application-level software. 
                I would like to apply my studies in Computer Engineering and computer architecture to problems, instead of only my software skills. 
                Hardware and processor design would be an interesting area for me to work on at least once in my career. 
                On a software team, I would like to work on systems programming, keep learning and gaining wisdom, and eventually gain credibility as an expert in my teams.
                I also want to work on a variety of problems, instead of being roped into a single long-running project.
                As for education, I would like to return to ISU or another university to get a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering or related fields when the time is right.
