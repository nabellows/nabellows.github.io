                    As engineers, we have an impact on countless people downstream of our work. Every
                    widely distributed product a consumer uses was designed by one or more engineers. Often the
                    people trust their safety to the work of such engineers, as is the case for automotive, elevators,
                    and many day-to-day technologies. With an established code of ethics, we can gain the trust of
                    the public to make the right decisions for everyone and the environment we share. We can also
                    be more assured that other engineers will be making similar considerations for us, even in the
                    presence of competition and other pressures to do otherwise. The code of ethics protects
                    public safety and welfare, the environment, and fair business interactions.

                    In our class, we have looked over the IEEE Code of Ethics, as well as other instructive
                    resources regarding the core “Virtues of Ethics” and the identification of ethical dilemma
                    through the “5 P’s of ethics” (the “five precursors of ethical violations”). The Virtues of Ethics
                    reduce some of the specifics of the IEEE Code of Ethics into the character traits that are
                    required to exemplify good ethics: integrity, honesty, fidelity, charity, responsibility, and self
                    discipline.
                    I think this list of virtues is thorough; integrity alone encompasses a wide range of
                    good character traits. Personally, it is easiest to identify an ethical dilemma if I realize my
                    decision could result in harm to others. Our class was shown the case of the Ford Pinto, where a
                    known engineering defect created a disproportionately dangerous crash-safety failure, which
                    resulted in injury and death. If I were an engineer on the team and had known about this flaw, I
                    would not be okay with management allowing the car to continue production until the flaw was
                    fixed. If management did not listen to these concerns, I would be inclined to get authorities
                    involved since the safety of others is being risked in the name of profit. This is ultimately an
                    application of the virtues of integrity, charity, and responsibility. Other ethical issues may not
                    be so obvious, in which case I would like to reference my company’s ethical guidelines, the IEEE
                    Code of Ethics, the golden rule (“do as you would like others to do”), and my conscience to
                    guide me to the most ethical decision. Raising concerns to my associates and superiors would
                    be an appropriate path to help guide my decision, but the final decision would ultimately
                    remain in my hands.

                    Another ethical issue presented in class was the case of the Volkswagen emission test
                    scandal. The company had been caught equipping its cars with defeat devices that altered the
                    performance and emissions of the cars during their required emissions testing, to allow them to
                    meet the various environmental requirements of their intended markets. The actual products
                    did not meet these requirements in daily driving conditions—it was only in the test, for which
                    they essentially cheated, that the vehicles were meeting these regulations. The behavior of the
                    Volkswagen engineers and managers responsible for the emissions tests violated the virtues of
                    integrity, honesty, and charity. All the virtues are connected, but this issue did not seem to
                    include the virtues of fidelity or self-discipline to the same degree as the others. By showing a
                    lacking moral standard by knowingly cheating on a test of any form, they did not exemplify
                    integrity. They were obviously dishonest, by presenting their vehicles as if they met the
                    required standards when they actually did not. Finally, they lacked charity and caring for the
                    goodwill of others, since they are ultimately harming others by polluting the environment. One
                    virtue or “good practice” that I think would discourage a case like that of Volkswagen is to avoid
                    shortcuts and focus on quality. By aiming to make a product of high quality, an engineer will
                    have less pressures to cheat or lie about the quality of their work. The virtue of responsibility
                    was also called into question, since few in the company took responsibility for the scandal;
                    many executives claimed ignorance and passed the blame down to lower-level employees,
                    even though the scandal seemed to be coordinated at some higher level. When discussing with
                    my classmates about the issue of responsibility in the Volkswagen and Ford examples, some
                    thought the ethical failure was more in the engineers, and others thought it was in the
                    managers. However, we all agreed that everyone involved had an ethical responsibility to
                    prevent such violations, and ultimately failed to protect the safety of the public in these
                    examples.
