                    My general education classes at Iowa State University have been helpful in my learning and development as an well-rounded adult entering the industry.
                    When it comes to solving problems and doing technical work in my engineering profession, I cannot honestly say that my general education classes
                    have any impact or presence in that process. However, there is more to being a working engineer and member of society than just problem solving.
                    Many of my credits outside of engineering were actually in the music department, as a side effect of my second major in music. 
                    All of my music classes obviously had a large impact in my development as a musician, which includes appreciation for different art, 
                    and a completely different type of attention to detail than in engineering. I also think these classes (and my other non-music general education courses) 
                    indirectly benefited me by giving me more interaction with all sorts of different people. 
                    The people I work with in the liberal arts colleges of music, economy, and philosophy are all different than my engineering colleagues. 
                    They had different strengths and perspectives. Another important part of my music classes outside of my musical development was my three semesters of
                    music history courses. In these courses we dove into not only other types of music around the world, but also their cultures and people. 
                    The later classes on Western music history gave me much more knowledge on the development of culture and nations in Europe.
                    For example, one seemingly random takeaway from studies of early Western music was learning more about Catholocism: their history and liturgy (and how it relates to music both in history and today).
                    This has made me more comfortable and able to interact and discuss with some of my Catholic colleagues about their personal practices and beliefs in an intelligent and respectful way.
                    Some of my professors and mentors in music have also given me profound life lessons, such as aiming to help people and find joy in life instead of working to earn paychecks.

                    One interesting field I encountered in my general education was philosophy. I took the course, 'Ethical Issues in a Diver Society' (PHIL 235) my third year at Iowa State University. 
                    The environment was very new to me, but I really liked it. In class we would go over the important parts of the assigned readings, and make sure everyone was on the same page (or perhaps, 
                    was able to get a brief overview if they failed to prepare the readings). Afterward, the class would usually be all discussion, guided by the professor. 
                    People had different opinons, and some people had stronger emotions on some of these complicated topics than others, but everyone was civil and we all were inspired to think and 
                    form new opinions on these problems. We also had to write our concrete ideas in frequent essays and review papers for the class. Our readings would sometimes be quite long, 
                    but it would still be interesting to read the words of an established philosopher as they would flesh out their ideas and reasonings along the course of the essay.
                    The whole experience was very much one of just thinking and asking questions, and letting other people help you form and direct your opinions. 
                    We discusses important topics about morality and human nature in a diverse society, tackling issues that are very relevant and discussed today, such as sexism, racism, 
                    hate, judgement, etc. Obviously as an adult in today's society, these topics have been on my mind often enough already, but this class was a great way to get a well-rounded
                    discussion with both myself and my peers.

                    The other field that I enjoyed in my general education was economy. I took three semesters of economy courses, including two levels of microeconomics and one course in macroeconomics.
                    The course in macroeconomics (ECON 102) helped me understand certain governmental and institutional processes better (banks, taxes, inflation, fiscal policy) to a basic level that I was completely lacking before.
                    However, my favorite part of economics was the microeconomics. Understanding human decisions with both mathematical and qualitative models was very interesting. 
                    With my mathematics background and interest, I excelled in a lot of the types of problems and really helped my teammates in our group lab work. 
                    While simplistic, the models of consumer and firm behavior were very interesting and helps me understand more about how our economy and pricing works.

                    Overall, my general education classes were very different from my engineering classes. In my engineering coursework, I would often spend hours in labs, writing code, or similar 
                    technical work. In my general education classes, I would often have to be reading papers, writing essays, posting responses or engaging in in-person discussions, and studying in a different manner than engineering.
                    I think the greatest value in my general education is just having experienced a diverse range of topics and fields, followed by engaging with people of those different fields. 
                    Coursework can make a big difference in your learning and behavior, but learning to work with different people could make as much or more of a difference in my professional development.
